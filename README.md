## About
Social Proxy JS SDK provides a JavaScript based interface through which websites can access the Social Proxy service.

## Installation
Social Proxy JS SDK can be installed via npm using the following command:

```
npm install --save social-proxy-js-sdk
```

## Setup
### Option 1
Migrate the `social-proxy.js` script (located in `dist/`) into your project's dedicated scripts directory; reference it via a `<script>` tag.

### Option 2
Add the contents of `social-proxy.js` to your project's `bundle.js` file (or similar) by importing it into the script manifest and running your build process/tools. Please note: at the time of writing, this method is untested.

## Usage
When setup correctly, `social-proxy.js` adds the `socialProxy` object to the global context (eg. `window`). See the documentation section for API usage details.

## Documentation
Documentation for Social Proxy JS SDK can be viewed by opening `docs/index.html` in a browser.

If all development dependencies (`devDependencies`) have been installed, the documentation can be (re)generated by running `gulp docs`.

For an overview of the project's evolution, please consult the CHANGELOG.
